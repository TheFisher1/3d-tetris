# 3D TETRIS
A simplistic 3d tetris game, written in Rust using Bevy 0.15. It is written as a final project for the elective course Programming in Rust at the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics of Sofia university "St. Kliment Ohridski".

### Installation and game start
Once you have cloned this repository and installed cargo, you can build it using `cargo build` or you can directly run the project using `cargo run`.

### Controls
The camera can be rotated using &uarr;, &darr;, &larr;, &rarr;; The different blocks can be rotated as well - one can use the built-in buttons in the play page. Moreover, tetrominoes can be moved in the 3d grid using [W] [A] [S] [D]

### Further add-ons
This project is intended to be a simple 3d tetris game, but can be further developed - through WASM it can be exported to a Browser. 
As for the game logic, new tetrominoes as well as new interesting forms can be can be included. I have stuck to the original game, however one can advance it, should they want, in any direction.
